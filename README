10/01/11   Mark Elrod     SafeListen 

SafeListen is a simple program that allows you to safeley listen to a port to see who
is connecting and what they are sending. The app can help identify security threats
and troubleshoot network applicationsa. The app builds on Windows, OSX and Linux.


Usage:

safelisten 80


Example Output: (note, the IP addresses here have been changed for example purposes)	 

Enter q to quit.

Design Goals:

A major design goal of the app was to give extremely limited power to the client app. Here 
is the initial set of rules that SafeListen followed:

- Don't allow the client to crash the app by sending an unlimited amount of data. The
app will read up to 1024 bytes and that's it. After that, the app closes the connection on the
client.

- Don't allow the client to hold the connection open forever. The app gives the client
up to one second to send some data. After that the app will close the connection. The
app was designed to be safe, not polite.

- Don't allow the client to overflow the app's input buffer. The app has a hard limit
on the number of bytes it will read to insure no chance of buffer overflow.

- Don't attempt to print binary or control characters sent by the client. The app
cleanses the data that is read by replacing all non-printable characters with a '.'
before printing.

- Don't allow the client to fill up the hard drive with log files. All output is sent
to standard out. The app has no direct file access, just standard out.

- Don't allow clients to over tax the app with an unlimited number of connections and
threads. The app is single threaded. The app has no obligation to accept every single
connection, and makes no attempt to do so. The app does not increase threads or 
resources used when an great number of connections are attempted simultaneously, thus
the app is not over taxed. The result is that some connections are not accepted, while
the app continues to work safely and comfortably.

The app will allow you to peek at how others are trying to connect to your system
without you worrying about them exploiting or crashing the app.

SafeListen has very few bells and whistles, so there is very little to break.
